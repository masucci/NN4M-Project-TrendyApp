<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

In this project, I've displayed all the items in a TableView. I also added some features like, Dark mode, different labels that gave a UX/UI more affordable for the user. I also added the Reachability file (provided by Ashley Mills https://github.com/ashleymills/Reachability.swift) that gave me the possibility to inform the user, with a different screen, if there is no connection.

I added some style creating a logo with illustrator and choosing a the right color palette for the target market.

I was careful to write a clean code using refactoring after the first time. Hoping that is good for you. Thanks a lot.:smile:
