<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

In this project, I've displayed all the items in a TableView. I also added some features like, Dark mode, different labels to improve the UX/UI. I also added the Reachability file (provided by Ashley Mills https://github.com/ashleymills/Reachability.swift) that gave me the possibility to inform the user, with a different screen, if there is no connection.

The logo was created with illustrator.

I was careful to write a clean code, refactoring and do some improvements after the first writing. Hoping that is good for you. Thanks a lot.:smile:
